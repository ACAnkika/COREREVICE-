# ðŸ§  CoreConceptRevise

This is my personal space to quickly revise core concepts before exams, interviews, or whenever I need a refresher. It's a simple tool I made for myselfâ€”no bells or whistles, just organized notes and a fast way to recall what matters.

## Why I Made This

I wanted something:
- Minimal and distraction-free
- Fast to open and use
- That stores only what I care about

---

## How I Use It

- Add bullet points or short notes on concepts I often forget
- Organize by topic (manually or via categories)
- Use it for quick pre-exam brushing

---

## Not a Public Project

This isnâ€™t meant for public use, feature development, or contributions. Just a personal utility built with React + Tailwind.

---

## Local Setup (for me)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
